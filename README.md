# FinancialReconcilation

# I HAVE SHARED THE LOCATION OF THIS SOURCE CODE IN A SEPERATE MAIL TO MATHIEU AND NICOLE

 The concept behind the project is to perform a financial reconciliation between two different sets of data
• You’ll have received these sets of data as two sample CSV files
• All you need to do is compare the two files, and report on how many transactions match perfectly, versus 
transactions which cannot be matched
• And those transactions which cannot be matched will need to be reported on, so that a third party could refer to 
the report and investigate the exceptions
• If a transaction cannot be matched perfectly, you should attempt to look for any close matches and suggest them 
as possibilities
